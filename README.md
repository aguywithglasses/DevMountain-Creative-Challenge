## Newsletter nav bar challenge
1. Please visit https://generalassemb.ly/ and take a look at the email newsletter bar they have on their website
2. Please replicate that email pop up nav bar. Mimic the functionality and design of that nav bar to the best of your abilities.
3. Please use a DevMountain-like design. Just take a look at the DevMountain site and try to make something that would work.
4. Send me a github repo with it hosted on github pages as an example.

## Results

I pulled down a complete version of DevMountain's homepage so I knew what I was working with as far as design.

As I investigated the sample site and brainstormed how to replicate the functionality, I decided to dive in and grab the code they use for this so I could mimic the functionality as close as possible. I've updated the design elements to match DevMountain's style.

When the page loads, after about 10 seconds, the sign-up dialog pops. When dismissed, then the bottom email nav bar appears with a functional "Sign Up Now" button and close button. This will hide when scrolled to the top or bottom of page and only works when the page width is So if you don't see it, just scroll a bit and it will show. Originally, dismissing the nav bar would set a cookie so the user wouldn't see it again for a year, but I've disabled this for this challenge and it will pop everytime.
